# pay-pies' personal site

This website is a site about me and what I do. It can be accessed here https://paypies.vercel.app/ and is has been hosted on vercel.

I used Vanilla HTML and CSS and Javascript within the style and script tags, edited in Microsoft VS Code (Visual Studio Code). 

## How To Use:

- Navigate using the topbar
- Switch between light and dark modes
- Just look at it I suppose.

Time spent: 4 hours 10 minutes 🟢->🟨<-🔴 (least time-consuming to most)

## Credits:
- Most of the dark mode javascript code: w3schools
- Most of the topbar code: w3schools
- Most of the light/dark mode button CSS code: [@ericafk0001](https://github.com/ericafk0001)
- Favicon & pictures: Pinterest
- Thumbnail: edited an image on pinterest on [pixlr.e](https://pixlr.com/editor/)
- The rest of the code: me

### Note:

What I mean by 'most of the ...' I mean that I used that code but edited it/added more stuff to it.
